# Sunhat 👒

## A Fork of Omakub, turned into a Fedora Config

### Note: This is my personal config. I wouldn't necessarily recommend using it.

#### Install:
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/gibbyb/sunhat/releases/download/1.0/install.sh | bash
```

- [ ] Add a way to change the font & theme of kitty using the script
- [ ] Add a themes for Neovim that are not using LazyVim
- [X] Configure GNOME extensions with cli tool.
- [ ] Add a way to update all packages installed with git in the packages folder.
